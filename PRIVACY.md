> # Privacy Policy for FocusBridge AI
> **Last Updated: December 2025**
>
> FocusBridge AI was built with a "Privacy-by-Design" philosophy. We believe your focus habits are your business, not ours.
>
> ### 1. Data Collection & Transmission
> * **Zero Data Exfiltration:** FocusBridge AI does **not** collect, store, or transmit your browsing history, goals, or sub-tasks to any external servers.
> * **Local AI Processing:** All semantic analysis is performed locally on your device using WebAssembly (Transformers.js). Your data never touches an AI API or cloud server.
>
> ### 2. Permissions Justification
> * **Storage:** Used solely to save your local focus goals, sub-tasks, and 7-day history on your machine.
> * **Tabs/Scripting:** Used to analyze the context of the active tab and inject the mindful "nudge" UI.
>
> ### 3. Third-Party Sharing
> We do not sell, trade, or share any user data with third parties. There are no tracking pixels or analytics scripts bundled with this extension.
>
> ### 4. Contact
> For questions, contact ivishalsinghofficial@gmail.com.
