# Privacy Policy for FocusBridge AI

**Last Updated: December 2025**

FocusBridge AI is built with a privacy-first philosophy. We believe that your browsing habits are private, and our goal is to help you stay focused without compromising your security.

## 1. Why we request "Broad Host Permissions" (<all_urls>)
When you install FocusBridge AI, you will see a notice saying the extension can "read and change data on all websites." 

**We require this for one specific reason:**
To provide the **"Smart Nudge"** feature. Because you might use any website for your work (from specialized research portals to common tools), the extension needs to be able to verify if your *current* tab matches your *current* goal. 

Without this permission, the AI would be "blind" and could not nudge you when you wander onto a distracting site.

## 2. On-Device AI (Zero Data Collection)
Unlike many other AI tools, FocusBridge AI does **not** send your data to the cloud.
- **Local Analysis:** 100% of the analysis is performed on your own computer using Transformers.js. 
- **No External APIs:** We do not use OpenAI, Google Gemini, or any other cloud-based AI. 
- **Offline First:** Your goals, sub-tasks, and browsing context never leave your machine.

## 3. Data Storage
- **Local Storage:** Your focus history, goals, and rules are stored strictly in your browser's local storage.
- **No Tracking:** We do not use any analytics, tracking pixels, or third-party monitoring scripts.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or share your information. Period.

## 5. Open Source Transparency
As an open-source project, our code is fully auditable. You can verify exactly how we handle your data by visiting our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ivishalsinghofficial/FocusBridge-AI).
